# PiggyPop--FinalProject for Handheld Ubiquitous Computing

# Summary
The goal for this project was to create a similar projecct to BouncingBall where a pig would bounce about the screen, and the goal was to place fences with a tap to put the pig back in its pen. This didn't turn out the way I wanted it to and I ended up crashing my entire Android Studio multiple times and could not finish it.
